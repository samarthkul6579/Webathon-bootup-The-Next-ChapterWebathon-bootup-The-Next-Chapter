// What is the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript?

we Use var for function-scoped variables, though it's generally recommended to use let or const instead due to their more predictable behavior.

we Use let for block-scoped variables that you expect to reassign later.

we Use const for block-scoped variables that you do not want to reassign.
