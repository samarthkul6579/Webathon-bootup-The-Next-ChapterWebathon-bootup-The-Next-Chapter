// How many loops in JavaScript, and how do they work?

for Loop: Best when you know the number of iterations.

while Loop: Runs as long as the condition is true.

do-while Loop: Similar to while, but always runs at least once.

for-in Loop: Iterates over the properties of an object.

for-of Loop: Iterates over the values of an iterable object.
